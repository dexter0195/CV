./cv.tex:25: Argument of \\ has an extra }.
<inserted text> 
\par

}
l.25 }
    
I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Runaway argument?
 \address {Via Giuseppe Bentivogli, 109/2, 40138, Bologna (BO) , Ital\ETC.
./cv.tex:25: Paragraph ended before \\ was complete.
<to be read again> 
\par 
<to be read again> 
}
l.25 }
    
I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.
